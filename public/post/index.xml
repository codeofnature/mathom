      <description>&lt;p&gt;Under what circumstances should we step off a path? When is it essential that we finish what we start? If I bought a bag of peanuts and had an allergic reaction, no one would fault me if I threw it out. If I ended a relationship with a woman who hit me, no one would say that I had a commitment problem. But if I walk away from a seemingly secure route because my soul has other ideas, I am a flake?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is it with that Mary girl?  Dragging me to school every day. As if I had a choice.  What you don&amp;rsquo;t hear in those nursery rhymes is that she starves me if I don&amp;rsquo;t go to school with her; it&amp;rsquo;s the only way I can stay alive!  I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about being adopted by Little Bo Peep, sure I may get lost, but anything is better than being with Mary and those little brats at school (shudder, shudder).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
